I'm a full-stack developer and data scientist with expertise in machine learning and software engineering. See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/sitnarf/).

## ðŸš€ Some public code

### [hcve_lib](https://github.com/hcve/hcve_lib)
   HCVE Library is a Python-based tool designed to simplify the process of data analysis and machine learning model development. It provides a range of utilities for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, allowing for flexible experimentation with different methods.

### [biomarkers-unsupervised](https://github.com/HCVE/biomarkers-unsupervised)
This repository is dedicated to unsupervised analysis of biomarker data, including techniques like clustering and network analysis. It supports a blend of Python, Jupyter, and R for comprehensive data exploration.

### [pipeworker](https://github.com/sitnarf/pipeworker)
Pipeworker is a simplistic framework for creating and structuring data science and machine learning pipelines. It enables users to build pipelines with interconnected data processing nodes. Nodes can be connected serially or in parallel to streamline processes like data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The framework promotes modular design and scalability, with planned features like caching and parallelism to optimize performance.

### [emoji auto convert for Signal](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/pull/4942/commits/53b9b6d73d6eb3f7ba42959b1b4f6dd81452d9d8)
A contribution to a popular open-source messaging app that converts text emojis to a graphical ones while typing.

### [infusion](https://github.com/sitnarf/infusion)
Infusion is a lightweight dependency injection container for Python 3. It facilitates the management of dependencies in Python applications, allowing for better modularity and flexibility in code. This project provides an intuitive API for injecting dependencies into your classes and functions, making it easy to decouple and organize components.

### [rename-guru](https://github.com/sitnarf/rename-guru)
Rename Guru is a tool for duplicating code while substituting a specified string across an entire folder. It respects naming conventions such as camelCase and UPPER_CASE, ensuring that replacements maintain proper format. This tool simplifies refactoring tasks by automating the process of renaming variables, classes, or other code elements across files.
